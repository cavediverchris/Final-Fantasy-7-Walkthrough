# Final Fantasy 7 Walkthrough and Story Guide
An open-source Final Fantasy 7 walkthrough built for fun and for the community.

I originally started writing this guide as my own personal set of notes when I first started playing Final Fantasy 7 in the 90s. Over time I've found additional pieces online to bolster it. I've been hanging on to this for a while and I thought that whilst I couldn't bring myself to delete it to free up storage, I thought it could go into the public domain and maybe others might want to help grow it.

I'm really interested in the lore of Final Fantasy so I would like to build this up to include the story.
