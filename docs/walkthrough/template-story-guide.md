As you move up the platform you will meet a pair of security guards that have come to investigate the commotion caused on the platform where you will be thrust into your first battle. In this battle you find yourself alone against a pair of guards. Press the ![Sony Play Station Circle Button](../general-assets/sony-playstation-circle.jpg) ) button to select the ATTACK commmand, then press it again to confirm the target as one of the guards. Each attack will take out one of the guards.

After successfully completing any battle, you will be awarded some experience (EXP) for your characters, some ability points (AP) for your materia, some gil and possibly some items.

After finishing the battle, continue up the train station and climb the stairs to the left.

Go north and talk to Biggs (the guy on the left). During the conversation, name yourself when prompted. Barret comes running in. Name him, and after a short FMV, you automatically enter the reactor compound. Follow the others north and west through the doorway.
