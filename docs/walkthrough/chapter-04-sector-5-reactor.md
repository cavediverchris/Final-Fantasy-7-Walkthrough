5.5.3 Guide












Board the train. 



When the ID. Check fails, follow everyone else and get off the cars before the time limit expires. After jumping off the train, you end up on the tracks.



If you run down five screens, you can fight Shinra Security Guards (Special Combatants), and build some experience. 





Otherwise, go up a screen, to the green security sensors. Walk left to the small hatch, and climb in.

  
Walk forward and grab the green Ether on the ground. 


Climb down the ladder to the grate, and then down another ladder. Run left and go up the first ladder you see. Talk to Jessie, and then look just to the left of the vent to find a Potion hiding.  Get it, and then proceed left and down the ladder to the left.

 
 
You can snatch yourself an Ether, and then drop down the next ladder. 

Run around to the little white flashing bag, it's a Tent. Go to the Save Point, and save. Talk to Biggs, and go up the ladder.


  
 


Now you are in the reactor. Slide down the pipe at the right end of the ledge. You should recognize the layout of the reactor. Run left to the door at the base of the stairs. Follow the same path as you did in the Number 1 Reactor. When you reach the core, Cloud has a flashback of Tifa going into a reactor. Sabotage the computer, and leave the reactor core. Exit the same way you did the other reactor, up the pipes, up the long staircase, and use the elevator.



Upon exiting the elevator, open the chest on the left for another Ether. 



Turn left into the room with the large panel in the centre. Walk up to the panel, and hit the button at the right time (Tifa will explain when you enter the room). Now go through the open door and save. I would recommend training to build up some experience, but this time I recommend using your magic to end battles. The point of this is not only to make your characters stronger, but also, when you use your tent to recover at the save point, it will be more worthwhile since it will be refilling most of your HP and MP gauges.

Through the next door and down the stairs is the boss. When you reach the T-junction, talk to President Shinra. He flies away, but leaves you to fight Air Buster.

Guide
Bolt is effective here. Air Buster mostly attacks the people he is facing. Otherwise, he has a weak rear machine gun. Keep hitting him from opposite sides to confuse him and deal maximum damage to his vulnerable rear. This can also be used to take the pressure of a character. Using a limit break on Air Buster’s rear can cause between 550 and 700 points of damage. If you get that opportunity, don’t hesitate to take it because you will make mincemeat out of him! Air buster can use his bomb attack approximately 7 times before he runs out of ammunition. He’ll then resort to using a weaker Energy Ball attack.
