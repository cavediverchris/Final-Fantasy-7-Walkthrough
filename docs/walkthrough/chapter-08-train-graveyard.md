Run inside the first train car on the right by using the metal grate. Run through and exit near the barrel. Search the barrel for a Hi-Potion. 



Now go back and climb the train using the ladder. Get the Hi-Potion on top of the car. Go up until you reach a large metal beam. Hop on and climb down to the left. Check the barrel to the north for an Echo Screen. 



Now head down to the right so that you are passing under that broken metal bar that creates a bridge like structure, then enter the door to the train to the right and get the Potion. 






Go down and exit to the right. Go across to the ladder on the third train. Climb across, and down the other ladder. Go up and enter the train. Go up, and exit the train. Get the Potion at the top of the screen, and leave.



Go up and around the train car on your left to get the Potion. 



Go up and around the next train car to the left and search the barrel for Ether. 



Now go up and all the way right to the engine. Get in the engine and it will push the car out of the way. Climb back in the engine again to back it up back to where it started. 



Run and get in the other engine to the north. It backs up. 



Climb the ladder on the adjacent car, get the Hi-Potion, and climb across to the left. Climb down from the train, and head left, to the AVALANCHE Hideout. 




Arriving in Sector 7 we can see that Barret is at the top of the pillar fighting, unfortunately Wedge get shots and falls from the top and dies. Talk to the old man hiding on the left to buy items, in particular you will need grenades, about 15 should be plenty, and then go save and start climbing. Biggs is hanging over the railing a short ways up. Continue your climb, and talk to Jessie. At the top, you meet Barret. Take the opportunity to adjust your equipment - Barret will now need to have a Mythril Armlet equipped to boost his stats. Also the materia that Aeris had equipped will now be in your inventory so get that equipped to Barret too. 

When you are ready, it’s time to fight Reno.

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Name  | Reno  |
| HP  | 1000  |
| MP  | ??  |
| Level  | 17  |
| Strengths  | None  |
| Weaknesses  | None  |

Any magic attacks work equally as well against Reno. 

Reno has a skill called Pyramid attack. When someone is under the influence of a Pyramid they can’t attack. Have someone attack the pyramid around them (not the character!) with a grenade to destroy it instantly. NOTE If a person had had an attack lined up before the pyramid was cast and then the pyramid stopped the attack being executed then the attack will be completed when the person is free. 

You shouldn’t find him too hard as long as you keep destroying the Pyramid’s quickly. Beware his Electro-Mag Rod, as it will paralyse its victim for a short amount of time and does around 75-100 HP of damage, so cure if your health falls into the 150-200 HP range.

After dealing out some damage Reno eventually runs away.

After beating Reno you’ll get to meet Tseng who is holding Aeris captive. , escape by using the cable Barret grabs. The entire section of the plate crashes down in a nice looking FMV sequence.
 
 
The party starts out near Wall Market where Barret struggles to come to terms with the loss of his team and worried about his daughter Marlene. Back as Cloud, go up to the wooden stairs and toward the plank, and Tifa and Barret will join you. Quickly head back towards the Wall Market and pick up the “Sense “ materia near the fence and get it equipped.


Go to Aeris's House in Sector 5. Talk to Elmyra to discover about Aeris’s past and why the Shinra are hunting her. Follow Barret upstairs and spend the night. Try to leave the house, and everyone joins you. 



Before you leave for Wall Market, go to the house with the boy you DIDN'T steal the 5 gil from (the house on the right), and he will give you a Turbo Ether.



Head over to the Wall Market the guy in the artefact shop sells materia now although you shouldn’t need anything as you have two of every materia now. Go over to the weapon shop, and buy everyone the latest gear and sell off the old stuff. The guy on the left. He will sell you three Batteries, you will need them later.




Go all the way north, near Don Corneo's mansion, and follow the group of kids that go running off to the right. 



Start climbing the golden shiny wire of hope - walk all the way up it to the steel girder. Jump off to the left, and walk down and to the right, all the way to the battery hole in the lower right. Insert a Battery. This powers the propeller and it starts running for a little while - until it doesn’t but it does now create a walkway. 



Jump up to the propeller, and walk up it, to the pipe. Jump off the pipe to the tracks. Climb to the next socket on the left and insert a Battery. 



Run up the beam and climb the cable. Instead of jumping across to the swinging wire, climb up off the top of the screen. Insert a Battery here. You get an Ether. 



Climb back down and jump across to the wire. The best way to time the jump is to jump just as the wire stops squeaking. Climb up the pipes and cables to the top.
