## Guide

Follow Barret up the stairs. When you talk to the flower girl, pick the bottom option, and then the top option. Exit the screen, and you end up in a large open space. Go south, around the large fountain, and then west.

Pick up the Potion on the left side of the screen. Talk to the man, and then exit south.

On the next screen you will be confronted by several groups of SHINRA soldiers, you might as well fight them for a bit of experience.

When you go  into the third battle, you will have soldiers either side of you. The soldier that strikes your rear will cause more damage. Normally this isnâ€™t a good thing, but you can use this to help build up your limit gauge. So kill the soldiers off in an order that means you are always getting someone striking your back for as long as possible.

You are now on a catwalk high above the ground. When you come to a T-shaped junction, go north, into the reactor.
